## üöÄ Introduction
Fantastic ‚Äî I‚Äôll give you a single, **actionable step-by-step roadmap** that takes someone with *no background* to the point where they can build, compress, and prototype a palmable RF ‚Üí pose device (the evolved ‚ÄúDensePose-from-RF‚Äù appliance we‚Äôve been discussing). I‚Äôll keep it practical, low-cost/zero-budget friendly, and split into short learning sprints + concrete projects and deliverables. Follow it in order; treat each small project as a checkpoint.

## üõ† Hands-on project checkpoints (what you must produce)
1. Toy OFDM & CSI simulator (Week 1‚Äì6).  
2. Teacher label extraction script from video (Week 10‚Äì12).  
3. Student baseline trained on CSI + teacher labels (Week 13‚Äì15).

7. Custom PCB + pocket enclosure plan (Week 25‚Äì30).  

---

## üí∏ Low-cost / zero-budget hardware options (start here)
- **Free / zero-fund**: Use public CSI datasets and Colab GPU for model work; use your smartphone for video teacher labels.  
- **Very cheap (~$30‚Äì$100)**: 2 √ó ESP32 boards for ultra-basic experiments (gesture/presence).  
- **Affordable (~$50‚Äì$250)**: used laptop Wi-Fi NICs (Intel 5300/AX210) + a cheap mini-PC or Raspberry Pi ‚Äî community CSI tools exist. Add USB Coral (~$75) if you need acceleration.  
- **Better prototyping (~$200‚Äì$800)**: Jetson Nano/Orin Nano dev kit + small mmWave radar eval board (TI family) or an AX210 card in a Linux host for higher-quality CSI.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Practical tips & common pitfalls
- **Phase = fragile**: Always implement phase sanitization early ‚Äî unwrapped, detrended phase is crucial.  
- **Syncing video & RF**: Start with claps/LED pulses for rough sync, then refine by correlating movement spikes.  
- **Overfitting**: RF data is highly environment‚Äìspecific; test in multiple rooms and with many people/clothing configs.  
- **Privacy**: Process video locally when creating teacher labels; delete raw video once labels extracted if you want to be privacy-first.  
- **Compute**: Don‚Äôt try to train huge models on Colab forever ‚Äî use small models and distillation for edge viability.  

---

## üìä Evaluation metrics you should track
- For masks: **IoU**, mean IoU across frames.  
- For keypoints: **PCK** (percentage within threshold), MPJPE if 3D joints available.  
- Latency: end-to-end inference time (ms).  
- Power: current draw (mA) at target battery voltage.  
- Robustness: performance across rooms, device orientations, and persons (present results on at least 3 rooms / 5 people).  

---

## üìö Free & high-value learning resources (what to search)
- Python & NumPy/PyTorch official tutorials.  
- DSP: short courses or chapters on FFT, sampling, filters.  
- RF wireless intro: ‚Äúmultipath, fading, MIMO‚Äù lectures (university open courseware).  
- Deep learning: Fast.ai practical course (hands-on), PyTorch tutorials.  
- Detectron2 & DensePose model zoo (to get teacher outputs).  
- Community CSI repos / papers (to learn capture & preprocessing).
